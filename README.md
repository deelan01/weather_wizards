Severe Weather Events Data Visualization Dashboard

#### 1. **Project Overview**
This project visualizes data related to severe weather events (tornadoes, hurricanes, blizzards) and their human, financial, and environmental impacts. The data is processed and standardized locally in PostgreSQL, then uploaded to a cloud MongoDB instance. The final product is a web-based interactive dashboard hosted on Heroku, where users can explore charts and graphs displaying weather event information.

#### 2. **Tech Stack**
- **Backend**:
  - PostgreSQL: Local data storage and standardization.
  - MongoDB (Cloud via MongoDB Atlas): Remote cloud data storage.
  - Flask: Python web framework for serving the app and providing APIs.
  - **Heroku**: Cloud platform for hosting the web application.

- **Frontend**:
  - HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
  - D3.js and Plotly.js for data visualizations (interactive charts/graphs).
  - Leaflet.js for geographic visualizations (map weather events).

- **Data Pipelines**:
  - Python (Pandas, SQLAlchemy): ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations for local and cloud databases.
  - MongoDB Atlas: Cloud-based NoSQL storage accessible from the web application.

#### 3. **Database Design**
- **PostgreSQL (Local)**
  - **Tables**:
    - `weather_events`: Stores metadata about weather events (type, date, location, severity).
    - `impacts`: Stores the human, financial, and environmental impacts associated with each event.
    - `geographic_data`: Stores latitude, longitude, and city/state for event locations.
  
- **MongoDB Atlas (Cloud)**
  - **Collections**:
    - `events`: Contains cleaned and aggregated data about weather events.
    - `impacts`: Document-based data on event impact (e.g., human deaths, financial loss).
  
#### 4. **Data Sources**
- **Tornado Data**: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
- **Hurricane Data**: National Hurricane Center.
- **Blizzard Data**: National Weather Service.
- **Impact Data**: FEMA, insurance agencies, public datasets.

#### 5. **ETL Pipeline**
- **Extract**: Download datasets from sources (CSV, JSON, API calls).
- **Transform**:
  - Clean and process the data (handle missing data, normalize formats).
  - Standardize and aggregate for consistent analysis.
- **Load**:
  - Store raw/clean data in PostgreSQL.
  - Export standardized data to MongoDB Atlas for cloud storage and frontend access.

#### 6. **Frontend Design**
- **Interactive Dashboard Layout**:
  - **Filters**: Allow users to filter data by event type (tornado, hurricane, blizzard), date range, location, and severity.
  - **Visualizations**:
    - **Bar Charts**: Display the number of events by year, and impacts.
    - **Line Graphs**: Show trends in event frequency over time.
    - **Scatter Plots**: Analyze event severity vs. impact.
    - **Geographic Maps (Leaflet.js)**: Visualize events on a map, with markers sized by severity and colored by impact.
  - **Event Details**: Clicking on a specific event displays detailed information (location, severity, impacts).

- **Interactive Charts and Graphs**:
  - **Plotly.js**: Interactive charts and graphs.
  - **D3.js**: Custom and dynamic visualizations.
  - **Leaflet.js**: Geographic visualizations for mapping events with custom layers for tornado paths, hurricane tracks, etc.

#### 7. **Web Application**
- **Backend**:
  - **Flask**: Handle API requests and serve the web application.
  - Serve weather event data from MongoDB using Flask routes.
  - Provide API endpoints to retrieve filtered weather data based on user selections.
  
- **Frontend**:
  - JavaScript and AJAX: Use asynchronous calls to update charts and graphs based on filters.
  - HTML/CSS: Build the user interface for a responsive and interactive experience.

#### 8. **Deployment**
- **Heroku**: Cloud platform for deploying and managing the application.
  - **PostgreSQL (Heroku)**: Set up Heroku's PostgreSQL add-on to mirror the local database structure in production.
  - **MongoDB Atlas**: Use MongoDB Atlas as the cloud data layer.
  - **Heroku Setup**:
    - Create a `Procfile` for running the Flask app on Heroku.
    - Ensure dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.
    - Set environment variables for database connections (PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
    - **Deployment Process**:
      1. Push the code to GitHub.
      2. Connect Heroku to the GitHub repository.
      3. Enable automatic deployments on Heroku for continuous deployment.

#### 9. **Version Control & Collaboration**
- **GitHub**: Use branches for different components (e.g., `dashboard`, `data-pipeline`, `mongo-integration`).
  - Keep a clear `README.md` for project setup and usage instructions.
  - Track progress with issues and pull requests.

#### 10. **Future Enhancements**
- **Machine Learning**: Predict the likelihood of severe weather events or their impact.
- **Real-Time Data**: Integrate APIs for real-time weather event updates and impact predictions.
- **User Uploads**: Allow users to upload weather data for personalized analysis.
- **Notification System**: Send alerts for new severe weather events using APIs.

This updated outline integrates **Heroku** for deployment, ensuring the project is accessible online with cloud-based data storage via MongoDB Atlas and PostgreSQL for local and production data management.
